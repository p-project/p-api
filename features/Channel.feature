Feature: Manage channel
  In order to manage account
  As a client software developer
  I need to be able to retrieve, create, update and delete them trough the API.

  Scenario: Create an account
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/accounts" with body:

    Then the response status code should be 201
    And the response should be in JSON
    And the header "Content-Type" should be equal to "application/ld+json; charset=utf-8"
