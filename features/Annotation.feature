Feature: Manage annotations
  In order to manage annotations
  As a client software developer
  I need to be able to retrieve, create, update and delete them trough the API.

  # the "@createSchema" annotation provided by API Platform creates a temporary SQLite database for testing the API
  @createSchema
  Scenario: Create a annotation
    When I add "Content-Type" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I add "Accept" header equal to "application/ld+json"
    And I send a "POST" request to "/user" with body:
